### Stack Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript React, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL

In the future, I would like to add api for food delivery service with affiliate links and monetize with ads. I would also like to use an api to help users find restaurants that are near them so the results will be based on an input of their zip code.

Currently, Users can decide between restaurants or recipes or both to determine the values on the wheel. 
They can also filter restaurants by local or chain places. 

### Deploying

When your new project is ready for deployment, add a new Heroku application with `heroku create`. This will make a new git remote called "heroku" and you can then `npm run deploy` which will push to this remote's main branch.
